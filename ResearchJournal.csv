left,Anthony  Antonellis,New York,"Anthony Antonellis is a New York–based artist known for his work in GIF-based illustrations, videography and contributions to the preservation and documentation of internet art. He is the founder of https://net-art.org/netartnet, a research initiative and database that archives digital art from the 1990s onward. Antonellis’s personal work, particularly from the 2000s and 2010s, is marked by a deliberately ""trashy"" internet aesthetic—characterized by pixelation, looping animations, and web-native formats. I’m especially drawn to his early explorations of GIFs as an artistic tool. The ways in which he recontextualizes GIFs—whether through physical installations or layered compositions—have inspired my perception of the medium, and act as a reference point for developing my own visual style.",https://64.media.tumblr.com/24580dba5ff72c7064d67f8ec0a87ba4/tumblr_mjq1c9Uieu1qhreumo1_1280.png,,"Public Domain, 2013, GIF",,https://www.anthonyantonellis.com/works,NetArt/Collection/Archive, 
leftDoubleImage,being human by Annie Abrahams,"The Netherlands, France","[being human] is a collection of digital poetry created by Annie Abrahams between 1997 and 2007. Spanning a decade of work, the project explores the potential of the internet as an artistic medium. On her official site, Abrahams describes the motivation behind the project as rooted in the belief that “the internet is an artistic medium that permits addressing people in their own intimacy, non-mediated by an art context.” Rather than functioning as a traditional website, Being Human unfolds more like a fictional universe—offering multiple points of entry and exit, yet still held together by a consistent theme. The work takes the form of interactive digital texts—questions, statements, and poetic fragments—that capture the complexities of the human experience. What stands out to me is the clarity and consistency of its narrative voice, which resonates across every element of the work.

leftDoubleImage,David Clark,"New York, Berlin","David Clark is a media artist, writer, and filmmaker whose work involves internet art, gallery installations, narrative film, and public commissions. Clark often engages with existing material to reinterpret and contextualize it. For instance, in 88 Constellations for Wittgenstein (to be played with the Left Hand), he uses interactive, non-linear storytelling to explore the life and ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Through animated vignettes, the piece connects Wittgenstein’s philosophical concerns—logic, language, and knowledge—to the structures and patterns of the digital age. The work stands out for how it uses digital form not just to represent ideas, but to actively reflect the way we think and make meaning. I find his approach particularly interesting in how it functions almost like a literary response—an interpretive dialogue with existing thought.",https://cdn.myportfolio.com/eed30e661290820e756262b9f000e887/6d20206c-8a8f-4b88-991f-df1c02356571_rw_1200.jpg?h=8fa4463cbd4ea751211ac3f95ae85a2c,https://cdn.myportfolio.com/eed30e661290820e756262b9f000e887/5f50432e-bf87-4df4-8fe0-8c294212057f_rw_1200.jpg?h=361b5c5f5451c6f80be0ec03ed15fec1,"A is for Apple, 2002, Net Art","88 Constellations for Wittgenstein, 2008, Net Art",https://chemicalpictures.net/,NetArt/Collection/Archive,

He created these personas during a time when he was struggling to find spaces to exhibit his work. The collective was a creative response to criticism that his work lacked stylistic consistency.

left,Joe Hamilton,Melbourne,"Joe Hamilton is a multidisciplinary artist whose work explores the relationship between nature and technology, often through the manipulation of landscape imagery. His interest in nature stems from concerns about environmental destruction and a desire to ""bend the concepts"" of nature and technology—juxtaposing the perceived simplicity of the natural world with the complexity of human-made systems. While his recent work is largely installation-based, some of his earlier projects exploring digital collages and how they can be used to embody this tension. I found Indirect Flights, a work Joe made in response to the idea of travelling in the internet age, particularly compelling. The layered imagery creates a sense of depth and even height, giving the work a three-dimensional quality. The concept is communicated simply but effectively, and the execution stands out as both visually and conceptually unique.",https://indirect.flights/img/facebook.jpg,,"Indirect Flights, 2015, Net Art",,https://indirect.flights/,NetArt/DigitalCollage,
left,Margie Rischiotto,Oregon,"Margie Rischiotto’s works are something I like stylistically. There’s a sense of playfulness in her use of shapes and subject matter, but on closer inspection, the imagery often hints at something darker beneath the surface. This tension is balanced by her bold use of color, which keeps the work visually engaging without tipping into discomfort—something I really value, as I tend to want to avoid overtly creepy or grotesque visuals regardless of my theme. I’m particularly interested in her use of layered 3D shapes and textures, which add depth and tactility to the compositions. She’s definitely someone I want to reference for my final project, especially in terms of visual style and how she handles y2k in a way that still feels clean and polished.",https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/SCZ5qS82jqNeSr6lquC_LqxolEE=/261593/format-webp%7Cwidth-2880/Margie-Rischiotto-Graphic-Design-Discover-itsnicethat-11.jpg,,"Xing, 2025, Illustration",,https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/margie-rischiotto-graphic-design-illustration-discover-280125,Illustration/DigitalCollage/GraphicDesign,

The only substantial source I found was a Rhizome interview from 2014, which focuses primarily on his more traditional, static works. I actually discovered his digital works through a Reddit post that had a lot of them linked in. His net art consists of very simple websites—often minimal in execution, each centred around a single effect or idea. This simplicity makes his work rich as a source of inspiration as they offer small but impactful effects I can potentially incorporate into my final project. Many of his pieces explore themes of disconnection and fragmentation, which align closely with the “collapse” motif I’m developing.

At first glance, the site appears unassuming and innocent, but as users navigate through it, darker themes of violence, sex, and death begin to emerge. Although it resembles digital poetry in form, the experience unfolds more like a piece of found footage—mysterious and unsettling. There’s an overarching narrative hidden within the pages, with each element acting as a clue to piece it all together. While the subject matter is not something that I’m personally interested in, I find the site’s development to be quite compelling. It serves as a strong case study in nonlinear storytelling and how narrative can be embedded in digital structure.",https://mouchette.org/cv/poster.jpg,,"mouchette, 1996, Net Art",,https://mouchette.org/,NetArt/NonLinear/UnfoldingPoetry,
